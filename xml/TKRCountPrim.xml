<!-- NB Maintainers - The following constants defining the layout of
     lead in the trays do not  propagate to the section of the
     file which describes the trays.  They merely act as documentation.
     At best, the code interpreting this file could check that the
     description of tracker volumes below is in accord with the 
     numbers.  In particular, 
       ** any change to numTrays, numNoLeadTrays or numSuperGlast
       ** will entail changes to the definition of the 
       ** tracker volumes.
