  <prim name="ACDSideStandoff" value="35.75">This one is right if
side_standoff is another name for side_tile_standoff, the distance
between the side of the tracker and the ACD tiles.  [Deprecated.  ]</prim>
  <prim name="ACDSideSupToTile" value = "35.75"> Distance from inside edge of
side support structure to inside edge of side tiles.  This is temporary, to
be replaced probably with a derived ACD constant which is the sum of the
support thickness and gap between support and side tile.</prim>
