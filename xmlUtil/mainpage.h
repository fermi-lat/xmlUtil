/*! \mainpage package xml
<p>
This package provides services for manipulating certain generic xml
elements.  At this time these include elements for describing 
constants and arithmetic  (&lt;prim>, &lt;mul>, etc.) and those having 
to do with recording the genesis of an xml file (&lt;source>).
These elements are used  in gdd.dtd, the dtd describing generic
geometry, hence that file and the xml files using it are also kept
in this package.  When xml namespaces become usable with a c++
parser it would be preferable to split off the utility elements
into their own namespace(s). 
</p>
<p>In addition to a test program, this facility includes stand-alone
programs to automatically generate special-purpose xml files from
an initial file describing an instrument.
